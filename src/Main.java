 * Date: 5/5/2024
 *
 * Team Members: Kris Bosco, Jesse Gemple, Karlin Clabon-Barnes, Kyle Peniston
 * Class: CMP_SCI-4500 Keith Miller
 *
 * IDE: Intellij IDEA
 * Programming Language: Java
 *
 * Description:
 * Program is designed to simulate a user-interactive game simulating the use of a generated 52 card playing deck.
 * The game consists of 12 rounds of patterns the user will be able to play through.
 * The user's objective is to guess the pattern by selecting 4 of the 52 cards until the user is able to figure out what pattern
 * the program is wanting.
 *
 * Functionality:
 * User will have the ability to select 4 cards from the generated deck through text field using card codes to select the card from the deck.
 * User will have the ability to check the 4 selected cards to validate if a match as occured in the pattern.
 * User will be able to quit the program any time using the "Quit" button or use of the red "X" button in upper right corner of the application
 * Program will record each group of 4 cards the user has selected.
 * Program will record each card from the group of 4 cards the program has selected.
 * Program will record each round the user has won.
 * Program will create a save state using file created within same directory to remember last round user has won.
 * Program will create a log file of what the program is doing per each execution.
 *
 * Credit:
 * Code examples and tutorials from W3schools, Stack Overflow, Udemy, Youtube and GeeksforGeeks
